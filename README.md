## Who are we
We are students from various fields like mathematics, physics, finance, economics, engineering, and computer science, united by our scientific approach to finance.

We know that quantitative finance is challenging, so we hold public events and bi-weekly Quant Circle reading sessions to connect and share knowledge.

Our goal is to create a space for learning, research, and sharing to build a strong foundation in quantitative finance.

Let's learn quant together!
