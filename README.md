# [Quantitative Computational Finance Club at Chulalongkorn University](https://www.instagram.com/quantcu/)
Quantitative Computational Finance Club at Chulalongkorn University (Quant CU) is a community of students at Chulalongkorn University interested in quantitative finance. Our goal is to create a space where we can learn, research, organize sessions, and share knowledge to build a strong foundation in this field. Our activities are supported by QuantCorner, the Thai quant analyst community.

We aim to approach finance using the scientific method and a multidisciplinary perspective. Our members come from diverse fields such as mathematics, physics, computer science, engineering, economics, and finance. We welcome students from any other department as well!
